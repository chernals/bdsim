 * @brief A base class for electric fields in local to be used in global coordinates.
 * 
 * This base class provides the aggregative inheritance and utility functions
 * for magnetic fields in local coordinates to be used in global coordinates.
 * 
 * Constness is particularly important here as member functions are called
 * from inside GetField function which is const.
 *
 * This owns the field it wraps.
